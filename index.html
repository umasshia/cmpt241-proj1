<h1>Project 1</h2>
<pre>
Unfortunately, before even coming up with an idea for my index page,
I did everything else for the project, so now I am drained of ideas,
on top of being exhausted. So, here it goes...
</pre>
<img src="https://turing.manhattan.edu/~gsamushia01/images/circle.png"/>
<pre>
What's that? It seems like a circle with diameter d and circumference c.
I wonder what we will get if we divide c by d...
We get Pie!.. I mean, <a href="https://turing.manhattan.edu/~gsamushia01/pie">&#960;</a>.
That symbol looks weird... Like it's a link or something...
